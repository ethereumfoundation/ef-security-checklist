  intro: >-
    Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, repeated, or default passwords.
    Following the advice in this section will teach you how to stay on top of breaches and secure access 
    to your accounts.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a strong password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If your password is too short or contains dictionary words, places, or names, it can be easily
      cracked through brute force or guessed by someone. The easiest way to make a strong password
      is to make it long (15+ characters). Consider using a 'passphrase' of multiple words, or
      use a password generator to create a long, strong, random password. Try
      [this tool](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) to see how quickly your
      passwords can be cracked.

  - point: Don't reuse passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If someone reuses a password and a site they have an account with suffers a leak,
      a criminal can easily gain unauthorized access to their other accounts.
      This is often done through large-scale automated login attempts, known as Credential Stuffing.
      Files with email addresses and their passwords having millions of records are available online.
      It’s easy to prevent—just use a unique password for each account.

  - point: Use a password manager
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      It is impossible for human to remember hundreds of strong and unique passwords. 
      A password manager is an application that generates, stores, and auto-fills your login credentials. 
      All your passwords are encrypted with one master passphrase, which you must remember and keep strong. 
      Most password managers have browser extensions and mobile apps, so your passwords can be auto-filled 
      on any device. 1Password is recommended by EF, and as a member you would get 
      [1Password Families](https://support.1password.com/explore/families/) subscription.

  - point: Avoid sharing passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      While there may be times when you need to share access to an account with another person, you should 
      generally avoid doing so, as it makes the account more vulnerable. If you must share a password—such 
      as when working on a team—it should be done using features built into a password manager. By creating 
      a vault in 1Password, you can share credentials only with those you choose, rather than exposing them 
      to the entire internet.

  - point: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      2FA is where you must provide both something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a 
      code from your device) to log in.
      This means that if anyone has your password, they still will not be able to access your account.
      It's easy to get started. Download [an authenticator app](https://ente.io/auth/) 
      onto your phone, then follow the steps for each account to enable 2FA and add it to the authenticator.
      Next time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code displayed in the app on your 
      phone (it works without internet, and the code usually changes every 30 seconds).

  - point: Avoid using SMS for 2FA
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When enabling multi-factor authentication, opt for app-based codes or a hardware token (Yubikey). SMS is
      susceptible to a number of common threats, such as [SIM-swapping](https://www.maketecheasier.com/sim-card-hijacking)
      and [interception](https://secure-voice.com/ss7_attacks). Your phone number is a public identifier and should
      not be used for authentication purposes. From a practical point of view, SMS only works when
      you have a signal and can be unreliable. If a bank website or payment service requires using an SMS number,
      consider purchasing a second prepaid secret phone number only used for account recovery in these instances.

  - point: Set up Hardware Token authentication
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      The most secure way to authenticate is a U2F/FIDO2 security key such as Yubikey. This is a device that you connect 
      while logging in to an online service to verify your identity. It brings several security benefits,
      since the browser communicates directly with the device and cannot be fooled as to which host is requesting
      authentication. Please follow the [EF Hardware Security Keys Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiQEDwV92hnrZhdgZk1paBp_HJtUlBOkUYYGZkJInFA/edit?tab=t.0)
      to proceed with getting and setting up your security keys. [Read more](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/71316/how-secure-are-the-fido-u2f-tokens/71704#71704) 
      opinion why this is so important.

  - point: Keep backup codes safe
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if
      your 2FA method is lost, broken, or unavailable. Keep these codes somewhere safe to prevent loss or
      unauthorized access. You should store them on always offline device, paper, or in an encrypted file.
      Don't store them in your primary password manager, as 2FA and passwords must be kept separate. By merging 
      them you defeat the entire purpose of second factor in the authentication process.

  - point: Sign up for Breach Alerts
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      After any website suffers a significant data breach, the leaked data often ends up on the internet. There
      are several websites that collect these leaked records and allow you to search your email address to check
      if you are in any of their lists. [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com) and [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)
      let you sign up for monitoring, where they will notify you if your email address appears in any new data sets.
      It is useful to know as soon as possible when this happens, so you can change your passwords for the affected accounts.

  - point: Shield your password / PIN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When typing your password in public places, ensure you are not in direct line of site of a CCTV camera and
      that no one is able to see over your shoulder. Cover your password or PIN code while you type, and do not
      reveal any plain text passwords on screen.

  - point: Don’t save your password in browsers
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Browsers offer to save your credentials when you log into a site. Don’t allow this, as they are not always encrypted, 
      hence could allow someone to gain access into your accounts. [Example toolkit](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData). 
      Instead use a dedicated password manager to store (and auto-fill) your passwords. Password manager extension in browser 
      will provide great user experience in a secure way.

  - point: Avoid logging in on someone else’s device
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Avoid logging in on other people's computers, as you can't be sure their system is clean. Be especially cautious 
      of public machines in hotels and airports, as malware and tracking are more common here. Using someone else's device 
      is particularly dangerous for critical accounts like email or online finance. When using someone else's machine, 
      ensure that you're in a private/incognito session (use File menu in browser to open it). This will request the browser 
      not to save your credentials, cookies, and browsing history.

  - point: Avoid password hints
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Some sites allow you to set password hints. Often, it is very easy to guess the answers. In cases where password hints
      are mandatory, use random answers and record them in a password manager (e.g., `Name of the first school: SmelledNotLikeHogwarts`).

  - point: Never answer online security questions truthfully
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If a site asks security questions (such as place of birth, mother's maiden name, or first car, etc.), don't provide
      real answers. It is a trivial task for hackers to find out this information online or through social engineering.
      Instead, create a fictitious answer and store it inside your password manager. 
      Make sure that your fake answers aren't autogenerated nonsense like "N_9bKTC_i94". Many password reset flows 
      involve communicating a security answer over the phone, and it's easy enough for an attacker to guess 
      "oh, it's just a bunch of random characters" and for the customer support to just shrug and let the person in. 

  - point: Don’t use a 4-digit PIN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Don't use a short PIN to access your smartphone or computer. Instead, use a text password or PIN code of undefined length.
      Numeric passphrases are easy to crack - a 4-digit PIN has only 10,000 combinations, compared to billions of possibilities
      when an attacker doesn't know the length and has to check every possible case.

  - point: Avoid using your Password Manager to generate 2FA codes
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Most password managers are also able to generate 2FA OTP codes. It is best not to use your primary password manager
      as your 2FA authenticator as well, since it would become a single point of failure if compromised. Instead use a
      dedicated authenticator app on your phone or laptop, with separate encryption and authentication.

  - point: Understand Face Unlock feature
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Most phones and laptops offer a facial recognition authentication feature, using the camera to compare a snapshot
      of your face with a stored model. It may be very convenient, but there are numerous ways to fool it
      and gain access to the device, if it's implemented incorrectly. An example of good implementation is Apple TrueDepth 
      camera system which uses infrared dot projector to build a 3D map of your face. It requires a realistic 3D facial model 
      or an identical twin to attempt to bypass (which is relatively rare). But general Android phone can be fooled by photo 
      of your face from the Internet, or from videos recorded by surveillance cameras.

  - point: Watch out for keyloggers
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      A hardware [keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_keylogger) is a physical device planted between
      your keyboard and the USB port, which intercepts all key strokes, and sometimes can type in malicious commands.
      It gives a hacker access to everything typed, including passwords. It is also possible for keyloggers to be planted
      inside the cable, so look for any signs that the cables or connectors have been tampered with. Data pasted from the 
      clipboard or auto-filled by a password manager can not be intercepted by a hardware keylogger.

  - point: Deploy offline password manager
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      For increased security, an offline password manager will give you full control over your most sensitive data,
      such as backup codes, seed phrases, PGP revocation certificates, and backups of your primary password manager.
      [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) is a popular choice, and it has many community forks with additional compatibility and 
      functionality for every operating system. Running it on a device that never connects to the network is required
      to achieve ultimate security.

  - point: Use unique usernames
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Having different passwords for each account is a first step, but if you also use a unique username, email or
      phone number during registration, then it will be significantly harder for anyone trying to gain access. The easiest
      method for multiple emails, is using mail forwarding. This is where [random]@service.com will arrive in your inbox, 
      allowing you to make your real email address private. [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/) and [DuckDuckGo Email Protection](https://duckduckgo.com/email/)
      are examples of email forwarders. Usernames are easier, since you can use your password manager 
      to generate, store and auto-fill these. 

- title: Web Browsing
  slug: web-browsing
  description: Avoiding tracking, censorship, and data collection online
  icon: browser
  color: emerald
  intro: >-
    Most websites on the internet will use some form of tracking, often to gain
    insight into their users' behavior and preferences. This data can be incredibly
    detailed and is extremely valuable to corporations, governments, and intellectual
    property thieves. Data breaches and leaks are common, and deanonymizing users' web
    activity is often a trivial task.
    
    This section outlines the steps you can take to be better protected from threats,
    minimize online tracking, and improve privacy.
  checklist:
  - point: Block ads
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Using an ad-blocker can help improve your privacy by blocking the trackers that ads implement.
      [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is recommended open-source browser addon. 
      When third-party ads are displayed on a webpage, they have the ability to
      track you, gathering personal information about you and your habits, which then would be sold or used
      to show you more targeted ads. Some ads are also malicious or fake. Blocking ads makes pages
      load faster, uses less data, and provides a better experience.

  - point: Ensure you visit a legitimate website
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      It may sound obvious, but when you sign into any online accounts or download software: double check if
      it's really an original website. If you use a search engine, often the top results are paid ads.
      Storing commonly visited sites in your bookmarks is a good way to ensure the URL is easy to find. When
      visiting new websites, look for common signs that it could be unsafe: browser warnings, multiple redirects,
      on-site spam and pop-ups. You can also check a website using a tool such as
      [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/) or [IsLegitSite](https://www.islegitsite.com) if you are unsure.

  - point: Use a privacy-respecting browser
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Your browser has access to everything that you do online, so avoid Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari as 
      (with default configuration) all three of them collect usage data, call home, and allow for invasive tracking. 
      [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Brave](https://brave.com/)
      are more secure, privacy-respecting browsers. Both are fast, open source, user-friendly, and available on all
      major operating systems. But even Firefox requires [quite a few changes](https://codeberg.org/12bytes/firefox-config-guide) 
      to achieve optimal security.

  - point: Use a private search engine
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      It is recommended to update your browser's default search to a privacy-respecting search engine.
      Using such a non-tracking search engine will reduce the risk that your search terms are used against you. 
      Consider [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/), or [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/).
      Google implements some [incredibly invasive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTsBP21-XpI)
      tracking policies and has a history of displaying biased search results.
      Therefore, Google, along with Bing, Baidu, Yahoo, and many others, are incompatible with anyone looking to protect
      their privacy.

  - point: Remove unnecessary browser addons
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Extensions (addons) can see, log, or modify anything you do in the browser, and some innocent-looking
      browser apps have malicious intentions. Websites can see which extensions you have installed and may
      use this to enhance your fingerprint, to more accurately identify/track you. Both Firefox and Chrome
      web stores allow you to check what permissions/access rights an extension requires before you install it.
      Check the reviews, GitHub repository, who's the author of the extension. Only install extensions you 
      really need, and remove those which you installed just in case.

  - point: Disable password storage in browser
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Do not allow your browser to store usernames and passwords. These can be easily accessed or exported.
      [Example tool](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData). Instead use a [password manager](/checklist/authentication/#done-use-a-password-manager).

  - point: Check for HTTPS
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If you enter information on a non-HTTPS website, this data is transported unencrypted and can therefore
      be read and modified by anyone along the route. Do not enter any data on a non-HTTPS website, but also do not let
      the green padlock give you a false sense of security. Just because a website has an SSL certificate does
      not mean that it is legitimate or trustworthy. Pay attention to the domain name: sometimes the difference between
      website.org and website.com can cost a fortune.

  - point: Use DNS-over-HTTPS
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Traditional DNS makes requests in plain text, allowing for eavesdropping and web-filtering by your provider,
      which by default provides you with their DNS service. DNS-over-HTTPS performs DNS
      resolution via the HTTPS protocol, meaning data between you and your DNS resolver is encrypted.
      A popular option is CloudFlare's [1.1.1.1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/),
      which has instructions for all supported browsers.

  - point: Use Incognito mode with caution
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you're in a private/incognito window, it will prevent browser history, cookies, and some data from being 
      saved, but you are still easily tracked unless you close all other browser windows and then connect to a VPN. 
      Even then, it is not fool-proof, so keep in mind these functions are not really making your actions anonymous.

  - point: Understand your browser's fingerprint
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Browser fingerprinting is an incredibly accurate method of tracking, allowing a website to identify you
      based on your device information—even after you clear all cookies and session data. You can view your fingerprint
      at [amiunique.org](https://amiunique.org) to see what parameters are evaluated. There is no perfect solution against
      fingerprinting, but using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) and disabling JavaScript in your settings 
      will reduce the data your browser leaks; although this will break many websites.

  - point: Block third-party trackers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Blocking trackers will help prevent websites, advertisers, analytics, and more from tracking you on
      all websites you visit. [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/),
      [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension),
      and [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) 
      are all very effective, open-source tracker blockers available for all major browsers.

  - point: Beware of redirects
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      While some redirects are harmless, others, such as unvalidated redirects, are used in phishing attacks,
      making a malicious link seem legitimate. If you are unsure about a redirect URL, you can check
      where it forwards to with a tool like [RedirectDetective](https://redirectdetective.com/). This applies
      to cases where you see a long URL with parameters you don't understand, which can look like 
      `https://legitimate-site.com/something/is?suspicious=b2ggeWVzIGl0J3MgZGVmaW5pdGVseSBzdXNwaWNpb3VzJw==`.

  - point: Block web notifications
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Browser push notifications are a common method for criminals to spam you and make you click their links, 
      as it is easy to spoof the source. Be aware of this; if a website asks you for permission to "Show notifications", 
      you should block it in 99% of cases. [How the prompt looks like?](https://d24oheizjk2k1o.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/25220742/smaller_hero-image-dangers-of-installing-web-push-incorrectly.png). 
      For instructions on disabling browser notifications, see [this article](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-disable-web-notifications).
  
  - point: Use Multi-Account Containers
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Using different profiles for work, general browsing, social media, and banking will reduce the number of associations 
      that data brokers can link back to you. [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) 
      is a unique feature designed exactly for this purpose. Alternatively, you could use different browsers 
      for different tasks, which is not as convenient but has the same security improvement.

  - point: Disable automatic downloads
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Drive-by downloads is a common method of getting harmful files onto a users device. This can be mitigated
      by disabling auto file downloads, and being cautious of websites which prompt you to download files unexpectedly.
      Any downloaded file can be checked for obvious infection at [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/),
      which will find known virus signatures. Or it could be opened on a separate virtual machine outside of
      your computer at [Any.run](https://app.any.run/), allowing you to safely examine any malware.

  - point: Disallow access to sensors
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Mobile websites can tap into some of your device sensors without asking. If you grant these permissions to your
      browser once, then all websites are able to use these capabilities, without permission or notification. 
      Such sensors allow to detect device movement and orientation, track position and ambient lightning changes.

  - point: Disallow location access
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Location Services let sites ask for your physical location. This should be disabled in settings as it 
      will give the exact location to meters. On every legitimate website, there would be a way to input the address
      instead of using the physical location. Note that there are still other methods of determining your approximate location.

  - point: Disallow camera/microphone access
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Check browser settings to ensure that no websites are granted access to webcam or microphone. It may also
      be beneficial to use physical protection such as a webcam cover and microphone blocker.

  - point: Strip tracking params from URLs
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Websites often append additional parameters to URLs that you share, to link you with the recipient.
      Example: `https://youtu.be/VTsBP21-XpI?si=1aBj9DFSaHk_XorM` has `?si=1aBj9DFSaHk_XorM`, 
      `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFAdz9HNRzu/?igsh=MXUxbnJ1czZlMWg0Ng==` has `?igsh=MXUxbnJ1czZlMWg0Ng==`
      which you should remove before sharing. You can sanitize manually, or use an extension like 
      [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) to strip tracking data from URLs automatically.

  - point: Install the Tor Browser
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      The [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) provides a browser that encrypts and routes your traffic 
      through multiple nodes, keeping users safe from regular technics of interception and tracking. The main 
      drawbacks are speed and user experience. Tor Browser could connect to anonymously hosted websites
      which end in `.onion`. For additional security consider using [Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System)](https://tails.net/)
      which boots from USB and does not write to the hard drive, ensuring no residual data is left behind 
      after reboot. It includes Tor Browser pre-installed for anonymous web browsing, and other encryption tools.

- title: Email
  slug: email
  color: teal
  description: Protecting the gateway to your online accounts
  icon: email
  intro: >-
    If a hacker gains access to your inbox, it provides a gateway for your other accounts to be compromised 
    through password resets, and for your information to leak (think about how much bank, travel, and medical 
    data has been sent to you over the years). Therefore, email security is paramount for your digital safety.

  checklist:
  - point: Use a secure mail provider
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      The companies providing "free" email service don't have a good reputation for respecting users' privacy: 
      Gmail was caught [tracking all of your purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/google-gmail-tracks-purchase-history-how-to-delete-it.html).
      Any US provider will provide your data on request by US government agencies.
      Advertisers [were granted access](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2018/08/29/both-yahoo-and-aol-are-scanning-customer-emails-to-attract-advertisers)
      to Yahoo and AOL users messages to “identify and segment potential customers by picking up on contextual 
      buying signals, and past purchases.”

      Start by registering a new mailbox and switching the most important communications to it one by one.
      Secure and reputable email providers such as: [Tuta Mail](https://tuta.com/secure-email), [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail),
      [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en), [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/), or [Disroot](https://disroot.org)
      allow mailbox encryption, are privacy-focused, as well as offer more security-focused features.

  - point: Secure your email account
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA, enable hardware key authentication, disable recovery using phone number  
      and follow every advice from the [Authentication Checklist](/checklist/authentication). Your email account 
      provides an easy entry point to all your other online accounts for an attacker.

  - point: Have more than one email address
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Consider using a different email address for security-critical communications from trivial mail such
      as newsletters or shopping. This compartmentalization would reduce the amount of damage caused by a data breach,
      and also make it easier to recover a compromised account. Email aliases and email forwarding are your
      friends on this path.

  - point: Share only public email address
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often the starting point for most
      phishing attacks. Use separate aliases for different activities and set up mail filters to apply distinct
      labels to incoming emails based on the recipient.

  - point: Don't share sensitive data via email
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Emails can be intercepted and recorded during transit. Additionally, you cannot be certain of the security 
      of your recipient's mail provider. Therefore, email should not be considered safe for exchanging 
      confidential information unless it is PGP-encrypted. If your recipient does not support encryption, 
      instead of attaching a sensitive file consider emailing a private link to the file, where you can later
      revoke the access by that link.

  - point: Don’t connect third-party apps to your email account
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you give a third-party app access to your inbox, they effectively have full unhindered
      access to all your emails and their contents, which poses significant security and privacy risks. For 
      Google accounts it's advised to enable [Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/),
      which limits what applications can be connected and what they are allowed to do with your account.

  - point: Use a custom domain
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Registering a custom domain allows you to switch email providers easily without losing your email address. 
      This flexibility ensures you are not tied to a single provider and can avoid disruptions if a service is 
      discontinued. You can get your own domain from providers like [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) for 
      under $15/year, which can be used for both website and email purposes.

  - point: Use aliasing / domain forwarding
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to `[anything]@my-own-domain.com` and still land in your primary inbox.
      Effectively allowing you to use a different, unique email address for each service you sign up for. This means
      if you start receiving spam, you can block that alias and determine which company leaked your email address.

  - point: Subaddressing
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you don't own a custom domain, an alternative to aliasing is subaddressing, where anything after the `+` 
      symbol is omitted during mail delivery, e.g. `johnsmith+[anything]@gmail.com` will be delivered to `johnsmith`
      inbox. This sometimes enables you to keep track of who shared/leaked your email address, but unlike aliasing, 
      it will not protect against your real address being revealed.

  - point: Have a backup copy of your mailbox
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      To avoid losing access to your emails during an outage or account lock, [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)
      can sync/backup messages from multiple accounts via IMAP and store locally on your computer. 
      For Gmail you could use [got-your-back](https://github.com/GAM-team/got-your-back/wiki) tool.

  - point: Be careful with email signatures
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Do not write your phone number or social network handles when you set email signatures. There are several
      marketing extensions that automatically crawl messages, and gather a detailed database of contact information 
      based upon email signatures for sale. One of your recipients will have it.

  - point: Be careful with auto-replies
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Out-of-office automatic replies are very useful for informing others there will be a delay in replying, but 
      sometimes people reveal too much information - which can be used in social engineering and targeted attacks
      right when they are away and cannot keep an eye on the account. Your email provider should offer you a choice
      who would get the auto-reply.

    Every message and photo you send has a chance to become publicly available. Don't write anything you'd regret
    and learn how to decrease that chance.

  checklist:
  - point: Use End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) messengers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      End-to-end encryption ensures that messages are encrypted on your device and remain encrypted until 
      they reach the intended recipient. This guarantees that any intercepted traffic cannot be read by 
      unauthorized parties, including those with access to the servers where the conversation data is stored.

  - point: Use Open Source messengers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If the code is open source then it can be independently examined and audited by anyone qualified to do
      so, to ensure that there are no backdoors, vulnerabilities, or other security issues. Most popular 
      projects will publish results of such reviews.

  - point: Use "trustworthy" messengers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When selecting an encrypted messaging app, ensure its server is open source, stable, actively maintained,
      and ideally backed by reputable developers. Some good options in 2025 are [Matrix](https://matrix.org/),
      which has many clients available, all based on a secure open source protocol, [Signal](https://signal.org/),
      and [Jami](https://jami.net/). [Tox](https://tox.chat/) and [Session](https://getsession.org/) don't even 
      have a centralized server.

  - point: Check security settings
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Go through the security and privacy settings in your messenger, including contact verification, security 
      notifications, and encryption. Disable optional privacy-leaking features such as read receipts, last online, 
      and typing notifications.

  - point: Secure group chats
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Don't use Telegram: every group chat in it is plain text unencrypted, just waiting to leak. For encrypted 
      groups in Matrix/Signal/Tox, the risk of compromise rises the more participants are in a group. Periodically 
      check that all members should still be there.

  - point: Understand media metadata
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Metadata is additional information attached to media. When you send a photo, audio recording, video, or 
      document you may be revealing more than you intended to: date, location, information identifying you
      or device may be included with it.

  - point: Verify your correspondent
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Prior to any financial transaction initiated in messenger it's always good to ensure you are talking to the 
      intended recipient, and that they have not been compromised. Make a call, find another contact through friends
      or colleagues.

  - point: Enable self-destructing messages
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Self-destructing messages is a feature that causes your messages to automatically delete after a set amount
      of time. Together with encryption this means that if your device is lost, stolen, or seized, an adversary 
      will only have access to the most recent communications.

  - point: Avoid SMS
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      SMS is not secure. It is susceptible to threats such as interception, SIM swapping, SIM porting, and smartphone 
      malware. It's ok to SMS "Message me on Matrix: https://matrix.to/".

  description: Minimizing the risks associated with using online communities
  icon: social
  color: blue  
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, giving
    people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate, and share.
    Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction and
    bring people together, they have a dark side - there are some serious
    [privacy concerns with social networking services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services).
    
    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even
    after doing so, all data intentionally and unintentionally uploaded is
    effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
  - point: Secure your accounts
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Social media profiles get stolen. To protect your account: use a unique and strong password, and enable 
      2-factor authentication. Never add your phone number in social media profiles: automatic scanners search 
      by known phone numbers to find linked profiles. You can reset a Twitter account password with SMS even 
      if 2FA is enabled, as long as a phone number exists on the account.

  - point: Check privacy settings
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Social media networks allow you to control your privacy settings. By default it would be too open, offering
      you to share your profile and actions with the entire world. Ensure that you are limiting what data you are 
      currently exposing and to whom, also this should be discussed in your family circle: often non-public people
      are easily found through their relatives.

  - point: Think of all interactions as public
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      No, the 'private' group is not really private. Every comment, like, and message are displayed to people and
      robots, and you cannot have control over it. Therefore, before uploading, posting, or commenting on anything, 
      think, "Would I mind if this was totally public?".

  - point: Think of all interactions as permanent
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Pretty much every post, comment, photo, etc., is continuously backed up by third-party services, who 
      archive scraped data and make it indexable and available for public or purchase. When you delete something,
      it's hidden from you, but not from moderators and admins – the data will remain there, and you cannot have 
      control over it.

  - point: Don't reveal too much
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of data that helps them personalize
      phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc). 
      Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls and spammers more munition to
      use against you, and can also allow to link your profiles in different systems.

  - point: Be careful what you upload
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Media you upload can unintentionally reveal a lot more than you intended. This is especially relevant 
      to photos and videos, which show things in the background. Most smartphones and cameras automatically 
      attach a comprehensive set of additional data (called EXIF metadata) to each photograph. Even if application
      was denied access to your location, it will guess your city from your IP address.

  - point: Don't grant unnecessary permissions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Many of the popular social networking apps will ask for permission to access your contacts,
      location, media library, etc. They don’t need this access, don’t grant it.

  - point: Avoid third-party integrations
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If you sign up for accounts using a social network (Sign in with Twitter, Login with Facebook, etc.), 
      you risk losing access to them if your profile is blocked due to a report or policy violation.
      Third-party integrations can download and cache your profile data and connections, making it difficult 
      or impossible to remove later. Regularly check and revoke access to social apps you don't actively use, 
      as they could be sold to a scam company along with all user data.

  - point: Avoid publishing your location while still there
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If you still plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait until you have left that place.
      Don't publish your plans in advance. This is particularly important when you are taking a trip, at a 
      restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public building or airport. Every international tourist is deemed 
      a wealthy target by local criminals.

  - point: Consider having a fake profile
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you just want to connect and comment and do not intend on being easy to find by all your ex-schoolmates: 
      consider using an alias name, and false contact details. 

  - point: Implement image cloaking
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Tools like [Fawkes](https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/) can be used to very subtly, slightly change 
      the structure of faces within photos in a way that is imperceptible by humans, but will prevent facial 
      recognition systems from being able to recognize a given face.

  - point: Don’t have social media accounts
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Social media is fundamentally un-private, so for maximum online security and privacy, avoid using any
      mainstream social networks. These social networking sites are owned by private corporations,
      and they make their money by collecting data about individuals, analyzing and
      selling that data, often to third-party advertisers.

  description: Safeguarding your network traffic
  icon: network
  color: violet
  intro: >
    This section covers how you connect your devices to the internet securely,
    including configuring your router and setting up a VPN.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a VPN
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Use a reputable, paid VPN. This can help protect sites you visit from logging your real IP, reduce
      the amount of data your ISP can collect, and increase protection on public Wi-Fi. All EFers are
      eligible for a VPN license, please contact [opsec@ethereum.org](mailto:opsec@ethereum.org) to get it.

  - point: Change your router password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      After getting a new router, change the admin password (it's not same thing as the Wi-Fi password). 
      Default router passwords are publicly available, meaning anyone within proximity would be able to connect.

  - point: Use WPA2/WPA3 and a strong password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When configuring a router, there are different authentication protocols for connecting to Wi-Fi. 
      Currently, the most secure options are WPA2 and WPA3. Disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
      if it's enabled. Set a nice password with 3-5 words in it, easy to dictate and type.

  - point: Keep router firmware up-to-date
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Manufacturers release firmware updates that fix security vulnerabilities, implement new standards, and
      sometimes add features or improve the performance of your router. Add a calendar event to check for updates
      once in 6 months.

  - point: Don't reveal info in network name
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      You should use a Wi-Fi network name in SSID that does not identify you, it shouldn't include your flat
      number/address or device model number.

  - point: Use a secure VPN Protocol
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      OpenVPN and WireGuard are open source, lightweight, and secure tunneling protocols. Avoid using PPTP
      or SSTP if you set up your own VPN.

  - point: Secure the DNS
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Traditional DNS makes requests in plain text, allowing for eavesdropping and web-filtering by your provider,
      which by default provides you with their DNS service. At least you should switch the DNS server.
      A popular option is CloudFlare's [1.1.1.1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/),
      which has instructions for many devices. If possible, use DNS-over-HTTPS which performs DNS resolution 
      via the HTTPS protocol, encrypting data between you and your DNS resolver.

  - point: Avoid the free router from your ISP
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Typically they’re manufactured cheaply in bulk, with provider-managed firmware that doesn't receive 
      regular security updates.

  - point: Disable unused services on your router
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Modern mid- and high-end routers have tons of functionality: it could be running SSH, file sharing services,
      torrent client, etc. These services should never be exposed to the WAN/Internet and should also be disabled 
      in the router admin. You don't want to depend on some older software versions included with router, these
      will lack updates and required maintenance patches.

  - point: Don't have open ports
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Close any open ports on your router. First, check the Port Forwarding or Virtual Server tabs in the router admin.
      Some routers also have a “Port Status” or “UPnP” (Universal Plug and Play) section that displays active ports. 
      When protocols such as PING, Telnet, SSH, UPnP, and HNAP, etc., are enabled, they allow your router to accept 
      connections from anywhere in the world. If your router has a device in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone), it would 
      have unrestricted port access from the Internet. Remove devices from the DMZ unless you run specialized server
      software on them. Disabling UPnP could also negatively affect torrent clients, some P2P applications, and 
      online real-time games on devices in your local network.

  - point: Set up a network-wide VPN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you configure the VPN on your router, then traffic from all devices will be encrypted and routed 
      through it, without needing individual VPN apps on each device.

  - point: Use a guest network for guests
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Do not grant access to your primary Wi-Fi network to visitors, as it enables them to interact with other
      devices on the network. You don't want people to connect to your NAS or mess with a smart TV in your 
      main network. Set up a guest network with device isolation in router settings; this is a common option
      in all mid-to-high level routers.

  - point: Change your router's default IP
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Modifying your router default IP address in the admin panel will make it more difficult for malicious scripts
      targeting local IP addresses, like 192.168.0.1, in hope to find an unpatched device with known critical
      vulnerabilities.

  - point: Disable unused remote access features
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Routers often have a remote management feature accessible via the internet. Most people don’t need this, 
      turn it off to prevent unauthorized access. Disable cloud-based management, where you can control
      your router on manufacturer's website or in a mobile application. These expose your network to potential 
      attacks.

  - point: Manage Wi-Fi signal range
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      It's common to set your router's range to the max so that you can still watch 4K videos in that remote cellar,
      but if you reside in a smaller flat, your attack surface is increased when your Wi-Fi network can be picked 
      up on the street. Look for options like “Transmit Power,” “Tx Power,” or “Signal Strength.”. Adjust the power 
      to a level that still provides coverage for your flat but doesn’t reach unnecessary areas. Use a second, 
      low-power access point with a reduced range for remote areas (e.g., your cellar) if you still need coverage there. 

  - point: Whitelist MAC addresses
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      You can whitelist MAC addresses in your router settings, disallowing any unknown devices to 
      connect to your network, even if they know your Wi-Fi password or have physical access to the cable.

  - point: Disable Wi-Fi on all devices
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Connecting to even a secure Wi-Fi network increases your attack surface. Learn about [Wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving).
      Disabling your home Wi-Fi and connecting each device via Ethernet sometimes is impossible, but you
      can disable Wi-Fi during specific times (e.g., overnight) using the router’s schedule settings.

  - point: Set up a firewall for incoming connections
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      If you want to run open source server software on your own hardware, but still have access from the Internet,
      make sure to set up a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) in front of exposed 
      server ports. Any router running OpenWrt firmware can also benefit from installing HAProxy with Geoblock 
      and Bad IP Lists. When properly auto-updated, they will block all known botnets from seeing your service. 
      Other options to explore are [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/).

  intro: >
    Smartphones have revolutionized many aspects of life. For many of us, smartphones are the primary 
    means of communication, entertainment, and access to knowledge. But while they've brought convenience
    to a whole new level, there are some ugly things going on behind the screen. Geo-tracking is used to trace 
    our every move. And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches, and potential backdoors.

  checklist:
  - point: Encrypt your device
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      In order to keep your data safe from physical access, set up a strong passphrase for your smartphone.
      All data is encrypted when the phone is locked, and decryption is tied to the user’s password or 
      biometrics. This will mean if your device is lost or stolen, no one will have access to your data.
      [Take a look](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1791833221165965567) at which OS versions can be easily
      hacked if someone has physical access to your device.

  - point: Keep smartphone updated
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Apple typically provides iOS updates for 6 to 8 years. Google Pixel Series has 3 to 7 years, depending 
      on the model. Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi, OPPO can offer 2 to 5 years of updates for certain flagship models. 
      The countdown starts from a device’s release date.

  - point: Keep your primary number private
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Your phone number should not be used for authentication purposes, yet every second website wants it.
      Make sure the number that your bank and payment provider knows is not the same one you use daily. 
      Setting up a prepaid e-SIM is the most reliable option. There are services that allow you to create 
      and use virtual phone numbers, but each has its own reliability concerns and caveats.

  - point: Turn off connectivity features that aren’t being used
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you're not using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC or any other wireless features, turn them off. There are 
      several threats that utilise these features. On an iPhone, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be turned off in two ways: 
      temporarily via Control Center or permanently via Settings. Use the Shortcuts app to create automation 
      routines that disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth under specific conditions.

  - point: Keep app count to a minimum
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Uninstall apps that you don’t need or use regularly. Apps often run in the background, slowing your
      device down and collecting data. When an application is allowed to show notifications, it also 
      automatically enables silent remote activation of the app to process any requests from the app backend.
      While this is technically required for notifications to work, there are cases where it is also 
      [used for user tracking](https://timsh.org/tracking-myself-down-through-in-app-ads/).

  - point: Only install applications from official sources
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Applications on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store undergo at least minimal checks before publication, 
      making them less likely to contain 100% malicious code. Anything you download and install from sources 
      claiming "free" games or software will be uncharted territory.

  - point: Always limit application permissions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Don’t grant apps permissions that they don’t need. Both iOS and Android have wide permission controls,
      running applications in a sandbox and allowing access to only certain sensors. Increase your awareness if
      an application requests access to any of these: Location, Notifications, Accessibility Services, Microphone, 
      Camera, Contacts, SMS and Phone, Storage/Files, Calendar, Bluetooth, Local Network.

  - point: Be careful with USB charging cables
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Hackers can physically "upgrade" public charging stations to install malware on your smartphone or tablet
      through a compromised USB port. Always deny if your device asks you if you allow to connect, but you only
      wanted to charge. [BadUSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BadUSB) is a family of attacks, where attached
      device can simulate keyboard and external storage. Now these microchips are so small, that they could be
      included [in a cable](https://nypost.com/2024/12/13/tech/the-scary-reason-why-you-should-never-share-phone-chargers/). 

  - point: Secure your SIM card
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      SIM hijacking occurs when an attacker fraudulently transfers your phone number to their SIM card, gaining 
      access to your calls and incoming SMS. Contact your mobile operator, ask for a "No Port Freeze" or  
      setting "Port-Out Authorization PIN/password". If possible, request that SIM swaps can only be done in 
      person at a carrier store with proper ID. This mostly prevents unauthorized changes to your account. Ensure 
      the password is strong and not easily guessable (3-5 words sentence is best). Go to your phone’s settings 
      and enable SIM card PIN lock. This requires a PIN each time your phone restarts or the SIM is moved to a 
      new device.

  - point: Opt-out of caller ID listings
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      To keep your details private, you can unlist your number from caller ID apps like TrueCaller, CallApp, SyncMe,
      and Hiya. This requires a request to each of these providers.

  - point: Opt-out of personalized ads
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      You can slightly reduce the amount of data collected by opting out of seeing personalized ads. On iOS, go to
      Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking > Allow Apps to Request to Track. Then Settings > Privacy & Security > 
      Apple Advertising > Personalized Ads. On Android, go to Settings > Privacy > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization.
      Review all other available options and reports in Privacy Settings on your smartphone to understand them.

  - point: Erase after too many unlock attempts
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      To protect against an attacker brute forcing your PIN, set your device to erase all the data after 
      too many failed login attempts (it's 10 for iOS and 15 for Android). This works bad if you have a small kid.

  - point: Check installed apps for trackers
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      [εxodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) is a web service that lets you search for any app and 
      see which trackers are embedded in it and what permissions (Android only) it requires. It's kind of a rabbit
      hole, since most applications request too much, and if you ask support why, it's very hard to get
      any meaningful answers.

  - point: Reduce background activity
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      For iOS, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle off Background App Refresh globally or 
      for all but chosen apps. Do the same at Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services. For Android, go to
      Settings > Apps or App Management, and disable Background Data to prevent the app from using data in the background.
      At Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization page, you can restrict the app's ability to run in the background.

  - point: Avoid custom virtual keyboards
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      It is recommended to stick with your device's stock keyboard. If you choose to use a third-party keyboard app,
      because it is awesome and free, think: why is it free? Google has Gboard keyboard for iOS users, Microsoft has
      SwiftKey keyboard, and many others exist. Keep the stock keyboard; it has swipe, cursor, and many other abilities 
      you can configure.

  - point: Turn off your device when unused
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When you restart or turn off your device, before it's unlocked for the first time, it's in the state which is 
      the most hard to hack into. While a sleeping/locked device would also ask to authenticate, it's not the same.
      Restarting your phone at least once a week will clear the app state cached in memory and even may run more 
      smoothly after a restart.

  - point: Watch out for Stalkerware

      [Stalkerware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalkerware) is malware that is installed directly onto your 
      device by someone you know, or comes as a pre-installed application on a new Android smartphone. Review the 
      list of installed apps on your device. Look for unfamiliar or suspicious applications, especially those with 
      generic names like “System Service” or “Device Cleanup.” Uninstall or additionally investigate any app that 
      you do not recognize or remember installing.

  - point: Consider running a custom firmware
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      If you're concerned about your device manufacturer collecting your information, consider switch to a privacy-focused 
      custom firmware. [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) runs on Google Pixel with Android app compatibility.

  intro: >
    Although Windows and macOS are easy to use and convenient, they both are far from secure.
    Your OS provides the environment for your applications and data, so if compromised, it can have 
    detrimental effects.
  checklist:
  - point: Keep your system up-to-date
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      System updates contain fixes/patches for security issues, sometimes improve performance, and add new
      features. Install new updates when available.

  - point: Encrypt your device
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Use BitLocker for Windows, FileVault on macOS, or LUKS on Linux to enable full disk encryption. This
      prevents easy unauthorized access if your computer is lost or stolen. [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html)
      is open-source cross-platform software for full-disk or volume encryption.

  - point: Backup important data
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Maintaining encrypted backups prevents loss of your data. Consider using [Cryptomator](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator)
      for cloud backups or [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html) for other storage media.

  - point: Be careful with USB devices
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      USB devices pose serious threats. Never insert flash drives or SD cards you find into your main PC,
      treat it as your PC would be having unprotected sex with a stranger. Seriously:
      a random USB drive has a [66% chance of malware](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2019/03/15/you-left-what-on-that-usb-drive/),
      it can actually be [a rogue keyboard or network card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BadUSB) masked in a flash drive case,
      it can [physically destroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_killer) your PC, or [try to kill you](https://blog.knowbe4.com/when-a-usb-flash-drive-is-actually-a-bomb),
      or maybe [29 types of USB attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/heres-a-list-of-29-different-types-of-usb-attacks/)
      will make you treat USB with caution. If your work is with media on external storage, consider
      making a USB sanitizer with [CIRCLean](https://www.circl.lu/projects/CIRCLean/).

  - point: Activate screen lock
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Lock your computer when away, and set it to require a password on resume from screensaver or sleep to
      prevent unauthorized access. Set a timeout for lock/screensaver to 3 minutes and increase it gradually
      until it's usable for you. Working from home is different from working in public spaces. Learn what hotkeys 
      or actions would immediately lock your operating system, and use them daily when stepping away from your 
      computer.

  - point: Disable Cortana or Siri
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Voice-controlled assistants can have privacy implications due to data sent back for processing. Disable
      or limit their listening capabilities. Consider using [open source](https://community.openconversational.ai/)
      software for voice commands.

  - point: Review your installed apps
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Keep installed applications to a minimum to reduce exposure to vulnerabilities that could be found. This
      especially relates to older software you don't use and forget, that is supplied with devices. In two years
      you change the printer, but old drivers keep running etc.

  - point: Review application permissions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Modern operating systems have introduced permission control features for applications.
      Review which apps have access to your location, accessibility services, file system, camera, microphone, 
      and other sensitive information.

  - point: Disallow data from being sent to the cloud
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Limit the amount of usage information or tracking sent to the cloud to protect your privacy.
      For Windows, [O&O ShutUp10++](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) is a free and effective tool.
      For macOS, consider [OverSight](https://objective-see.org/products/oversight.html) for microphone/camera monitoring 
      and [LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html) for controlling which apps can access the Internet.

  - point: Understand quick unlock and standby mode implications
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you restart or turn off your device, before it's unlocked for the first time, it's in the state which is 
      the hardest to hack into. While a sleeping/locked device would also ask to authenticate, it's not the same.
      Shut down your device when not in use to keep data secure. Use a strong password instead of a short PIN
      code for unlocking your computer to enhance security.

  - point: Don't use root/admin account for daily tasks
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Use an unprivileged user account for daily tasks and only elevate permissions for administrative changes
      to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities.

  - point: Use a privacy filter
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Purchase a screen privacy filter if you use your device in public spaces to prevent shoulder surfing and 
      protect sensitive information.

  - point: Randomize your Wi-Fi hardware address
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Modify or randomize your MAC address to protect against tracking by Wi-Fi network owners, which happens 
      in most public networks for different reasons. Look for Private Wi-Fi Address or Random Hardware Address 
      setting in your wireless network settings and enable it.

  - point: Use a firewall
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Install a firewall app to monitor and block unwanted Internet access by certain applications, protecting
      against remote access attacks and privacy breaches. Consider [LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html)
      for macOS and [Portmaster](https://github.com/safing/portmaster) for Windows/Linux.

  - point: Use virtual machines
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Use virtual machines for risky activities or running software you may want to use only a couple of times 
      to isolate potential threats from your primary system. Modern computers can usually run at least one
      virtual machine without noticeable performance downgrades. [Any.run](https://app.any.run/) can run
      Windows/Linux apps on their servers and show execution analysis in your browser. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
      is available for all desktop operating systems and has an easy GUI, but many advanced alternatives
      exist. As an operating system for the virtual machine, consider [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
      or [Tails OS](https://tails.net/).

  - point: Set the BIOS password
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Enable a BIOS/UEFI password to prevent someone from modifying the boot settings of your computer. On Mac computers, 
      the equivalent of a BIOS/UEFI password is called a Firmware Password. This prevents anyone from 
      booting their OS on your device, or modifying startup settings. Record this password in a
      password manager; you will need it to reinstall the OS or sell your device in the future. Instructions for:
      [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102384), [Dell](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000219905/how-to-set-a-bios-admin-password-on-a-dell-computer),

  - point: Use Canary Tokens
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Deploy canary tokens to detect unauthorized access to your files, emails, or system and sometimes gather
      information about the intruder. When attackers interact with the honeypot, it will send you an alert. 
      [OpenCanary](https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary) can be installed on your server or you can create
      [canary tokens](https://canarytokens.org/nest/) online.

  icon: home
  color: red
  intro: >-
    The most privacy-respecting option is to not use "smart" Internet-connected devices in your home. However, 
    since we do use them, it is important to fully understand the risks associated with any given product 
    before buying it. The following checklist will help mitigate the risks associated with "smart" devices.
  checklist:
  - point: Understand Alexa/Google Home/Siri risks
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Voice assistants (such as Google Home, Alexa, and Siri) and other Internet-connected
      devices collect large amounts of personal data (including voice samples, location data,
      home details, and logs of all interactions). Since you have limited control over what is
      being collected, how it's stored, and what it will be used for, this makes it hard to
      recommend any consumer smart-home products to anyone who cares about privacy and security.

  - point: Rename devices and update passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      During or after the first setup, change default device names. Do not include any personal 
      identifiers, and do not specify brand/model to prevent targeted attacks. Update PIN codes and
      passwords from the defaults. Save all updated information to your password manager.

  - point: Build a self-hosted smart home
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a recommended open-source solution for building a smart home,
      supporting thousands of integrations by hundreds of active contributors. Using it as the core of your setup
      will guarantee longevity and privacy.

  - point: Understand what data is collected, stored and transmitted
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Research and ensure comfort with the data handling practices of smart home devices before purchase, avoiding 
      devices that share data with third parties, or don't have hardware switches to turn off microphones and cameras
      at will.

  - point: Adjust privacy settings and opt out of sharing data with third parties
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Adjust app settings for strictest privacy controls and opt-out of data sharing with third parties wherever possible.
      Pay attention to default checkboxes on sign-up. Consider using a fake name and a forwarder email address; 
      your vacuum cleaner doesn't need to know real ones. Avoiding sign-up/log-in via social media or other third-party 
      services to maintain privacy.

  - point: Keep firmware up-to-date
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Regularly check for updates to smart device firmware to apply security patches and enhancements. Lack of updates
      for years means no one cares about it anymore. If there is no alternative open-source firmware, you should prepare
      to follow the "planned aging" decided by the manufacturer – and avoid purchasing any new hardware from them.

  - point: Don't connect everything in your home to the Internet
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Evaluate the risks of internet-connected thermostats, alarms, and detectors due to potential remote access by hackers.
      If you are building your smart home, select devices that communicate using Zigbee, [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/),
      or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) with a local gateway you control. Controlling your smart LED light through a server in 
      China is wrong, slow, and insecure (yes, Xiaomi, we are looking at you!).

  - point: Be wary of wearable devices
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Consider the extensive data collection capabilities of wearable devices and their implications for privacy.
      Often these devices offer to share your every activity with "friends," which sometimes means anyone interested 
      in tracking where and what you do. Even if sharing is off, some devices would respond to Bluetooth requests, 
      allowing to track your presence.
  
  - point: Monitor your home network closely
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Use tools like [Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap/), [Fing](https://www.fing.com/) or router features to monitor for unusual 
      network activity.

  intro: >-
    Money is the primary target for criminals, more valuable than your data. When using any forms of 
    digital assets, it's more important than ever to take precautionary steps to protect yourself from 
    falling victim.

  checklist:
  - point: Sign up for fraud alerts and credit monitoring
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Enable fraud alerts and credit monitoring through Experian, TransUnion, Equifax, or your local credit score provider 
      to be alerted of suspicious activity: you should get an alert each time somebody requests your credit history,
      which lists your accounts at different banks and their financial state over time.

  - point: Request a credit freeze
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Prevent unauthorized credit inquiries by freezing your credit through Experian, TransUnion, Equifax, or your local 
      credit score provider.

  - point: Diversify your assets
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Don’t keep all your funds in one wallet, account, or bank. Use multiple [wallets](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/)
      or accounts to diversify risk; if one is compromised, you won’t lose everything. There are many ways and tools to keep 
      your personal finances in order, and they will help you keep track of your accounts. Consider having a scheme like this:
      a software wallet in browser for tiny amounts, donations etc; a hardware wallet for the assets you would like
      to access periodically; a 'cold' paper wallet for long-term storage.

  - point: Use virtual cards
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Utilize virtual card numbers for online transactions to protect your real banking details. Services like 
      [Privacy.com](https://privacy.com) (US-only) offer such features. Check tariffs of your local banks: it may be
      possible to issue new cards just on your smartphone. Consider using a credit card with zero credit limit if
      you are renting a car or other vehicle.

  - point: Use a secret phone number for your primary bank
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Phone numbers should not be used for authentication, yet they are still a common method banks use. 
      Make sure you don't register your public phone number with the bank where you keep most of your assets. 
      Utilize all advice from [Authentication](/checklist/authentication/) and [Mobile Devices](/checklist/mobile-devices/) 
      sections for your payment accounts.

  - point: Use cryptocurrencies wisely
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Opt for cryptocurrencies for international transactions to keep fees low and store share of your assets for 
      diversification. However, use cryptocurrencies wisely: everything is recorded on a public blockchain and analyzed, 
      so your activity can reveal your identity. Cryptocurrencies are not completely anonymous.

  - point: Store cryptocurrencies securely
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Only store cryptocurrencies in non-custodial wallets. For accounts holding more than $1000, use offline wallet 
      generation and hardware wallets like [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) with a proper backup. Learn what a multi-sig wallet is; when your 
      friends or colleagues use crypto, wallets like [Safe](https://safe.global/wallet) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) 
      provide you with an ultimate level of security for crypto assets and reliable recovery methods.

  - point: Backup seed words and private keys
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Backup your wallet recovery phrases, private keys, and important account details on physical media. Write down,
      use key separation techniques like [Shamir's secret sharing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing)
      to break a secret into multiple shards. Lord Voldemort did it (kind of), you should do it too.
    
  - point: Use cash for local transactions
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Pay with cash for local and everyday purchases to avoid financial profiling. Remember that all affiliate and
      cashback programs are tracking you to sell your data.

  - point: Buy cryptocurrencies anonymously
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Purchase cryptocurrencies without linking to your identity through services like [Bisq](https://bisq.network/), 
      or Crypto ATMs. Use [separate wallets](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/) for different purposes:
      until you send transactions between them it's extremely hard to link different wallets to one identity.

  - point: Learn about coin tumblers/mixers
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Coin tumblers are services designed to enhance the privacy of cryptocurrency transactions. They work by pooling 
      together funds from multiple users and then redistributing them, thereby breaking the direct link between the 
      source and destination of the coins that can be traced through blockchain. While these mixers are valuable for 
      protecting user privacy, they have also attracted attention from regulators and law enforcement due to their 
      potential misuse in money laundering and other illicit activities. You should be aware of both the privacy 
      benefits and the legal implications of using such services.
      Bitcoin mixers use techniques such as CoinJoin, where multiple transactions are combined into one, making it 
      harder to trace individual coin histories. On Ethereum, decentralized mixing services like Tornado Cash use 
      smart contracts to mix ETH and ERC-20 tokens, effectively obfuscating transaction trails. 
      Be cautious, since such services could be illegal in your location, and their usage faces regulatory scrutiny.

  - point: Use an alias for online shopping
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      For online purchases, consider using a fake identity with a forwarding email address, virtual phone number, 
      and secure delivery methods (such as PO Boxes, forwarding addresses, or local pickup locations) to protect your 
      identity and avoid linking purchases directly to you.

  intro: >-
      Many data breaches, hacks and attacks are caused by human error. Hackers learn human psychology, and you should 
      too. The following list contains steps you should take to reduce the risk of this happening to you.

  checklist:
  - point: Verify counterparties
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Always verify the identity of individuals requesting sensitive information—whether by phone, email, or in person. 
      Call back and use separate communication channels to validate requests. Emails can be easily spoofed. Verify the 
      sender's authenticity, especially for sensitive actions, and prefer entering URLs manually rather than clicking 
      links in emails.

  - point: Do not assume a site is secure, just because it is `HTTPS`
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      HTTPS does not guarantee a website's legitimacy. Verify URLs and exercise caution with personal data.

  - point: Aim for social media privacy
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Limit the amount of personal and professional information available publicly on social platforms. This helps reduce 
      the risk of attackers gathering details to craft convincing scams. Check and update your social media 
      settings, as unsafe defaults may affect your privacy.

  - point: Don't trust virtual interactions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Common techniques such as phishing (emails that impersonate trusted entities), vishing (voice scams), smishing 
      (SMS scams), baiting, pretexting, and tailgating are used by malicious actors. Read articles, watch online courses, 
      and review real-life case studies to learn how they look like. Treat unsolicited calls, emails, or messages 
      offering free tech support, giveaways, or “too good to be true” deals with extreme caution.

  - point: Learn cognitive biases and psychological triggers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Familiarize yourself with biases like [authority bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias) (trusting 
      figures of authority), [social proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof) (following the crowd), 
      [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity_(social_psychology)#Effects_of_scarcity_in_humans) (the lure of 
      limited opportunities), [reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)) (feeling 
      obliged to return a favor), and others.

  - point: Practice critical thinking
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Develop a habit of “double-checking” any request for personal or financial information. Ask yourself, “Does this 
      trigger an emotional response?” If yes, take extra time to analyze it. Excitement around winning or loosing,
      threat or danger to you and family is often exploited by criminals.

  - point: Opt-out of public databases
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      On every occasion remove yourself from public databases and marketing lists to reduce unwanted contacts and 
      potential risks. Do not provide additional personal information when opting out of data services to avoid 
      further data collection. [Example opt-out](https://www.clearview.ai/privacy-and-requests) page for a service
      which downloaded 50 billions of photos to provide commercial face recognition services.

  - point: Blur your profile
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Use different combinations of fake names, addresses, and emails for all non-important, non-government interactions.
      Let the bookshop think you are another person. The delivery service can call you by a fake name without knowing it.
      Your nonexistent sibling purchases all these board games from a local store. When this data leaks 
      ([Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com) is listing thousand of the biggest leaks to check), it would be 
      a nightmare for anyone trying to compile your profile.

  - point: Compartmentalize
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Keep different areas of digital activity separate to limit data exposure in case of a breach. Your work laptop
      and accounts shouldn't contain your personal data. Your child should never be allowed to use your devices.
      Encrypt everything you archive. If you have fewer than 5 separate encrypted containers now, you are probably 
      approaching it wrongly. Don't save top-secret stuff on an encrypted volume you mount daily. Trade cryptocurrencies 
      and run your wallets in a separate browser that is not used for other activities.

  - point: Develop a family security protocol
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Create a checklist for handling sensitive communications. For instance, decide that you will never share passwords 
      or financial information over unsolicited phone calls, chats or emails without independent verification. Write down 
      your own “rules” and refer to them when you’re unsure. Use encrypted messaging apps within your family circle.

- title: Physical Security
  slug: physical-security
  description: Taking measures to prevent IRL security incidents
  icon: physical
  color: lime
  intro: >-
    Physical security is what really matters to you. Sometimes perceived as granted in the most developed countries,
    it can diminish in days or hours. Always consider the physical security of you and your family first when applying
    advice (like this one) from the Internet. Know local laws, and learn what's in local common sense. This section is 
    more like a set of open questions to investigate than a set of rules.

  checklist:
  - point: Understand public records
    priority: Essential
    details: |
      Public records are documents or pieces of information that are not considered confidential and relate to government 
      activities. Examples of public records includes information pertaining to births, deaths, marriages, and documented 
      transaction with government agencies. It means that even if you follow each and every advice in all sections of
      this checklist, your government will still have, and publish, and leak some information about your, your closest
      relatives or co-habitants. Then your data ends in numerous databases, and can be requested through software like
      [CLEAR](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/clear). In a modern world it's extremely hard to be untraced,
      so don't expect you are, keep low profile and stay prepared.

  - point: Don't reveal info on calls
    priority: Essential
    details: |
      Assume your voice call is recorded, automatically analysed and transcribed, labeled and saved – unless you use
      open source verified communication software that keeps the talk encrypted, and you verified the encryption keys with 
      your interlocutor.

  - point: Understand border searches
    priority: Essential
    details: |
      Sometimes when you try to enter a foreign country which neglects digital privacy rights (e.g. USA, Australia,
      New Zealand) you may be required by a border officer to unlock your laptop/smartphone for inspection. This is a 
      potentially difficult situation, which EFF [describes as no-win in their Border Guide](https://www.eff.org/issues/border-searches). 
      During this process you may be separated from your devices for an undefined amount of time and will have zero control 
      on what's happening with your data during the inspection and after it. A digital copy of all device contents may be taken without a
      warrant, your knowledge or explicit consent. If you refuse to disclose your PIN/password, most probably you will 
      be detained and denied entry to the country and your device may still be "temporarily" confiscated to be processed 
      by special digital forensics tools.

  - point: Destroy sensitive data before disposal
    priority: Essential
    details: |
      Shred sensitive documents before disposal to protect against identity theft and maintain confidentiality.
      Don't just put them in trash, burn if required. Your old flash drives and hard drives still store your data,
      unless you go through a proper timely wipe process, not a quick formatting. The smartphone which you deem unrepairable
      still has your data in memory on chip.

  - point: Secure the perimeter
    priority: Essential
    details: |
      Ensure physical security of locations storing documents and devices, minimizing external access and using 
      automated intrusion detection. This includes the installation of safes, exchanging contacts with
      neighbors, learning what alarm systems can and cannot do, and installing what makes sense in your case.

  - point: Prepare for emergency
    priority: Essential
    details: |
      Social unrest, technogenic catastrophes, climatic extremes can return the society around you into 18th century
      and beyond very fast. Always have a supply of water, food and your medicines. 7 days reserve is enough, if
      situation becomes really bad you should consider evacuation, not preparation.
