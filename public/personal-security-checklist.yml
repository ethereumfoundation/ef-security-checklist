  intro: >-
    Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, repeated, or default passwords.
    Following the advice in this section will teach you how to stay on top of breaches and secure access 
    to your accounts.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a strong password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If your password is too short or contains dictionary words, places, or names, it can be easily
      cracked through brute force or guessed by someone. The easiest way to make a strong password
      is to make it long (15+ characters). Consider using a 'passphrase' of multiple words, or
      use a password generator to create a long, strong, random password. Try
      [this tool](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) to see how quickly your
      passwords can be cracked.

  - point: Don't reuse passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If someone reuses a password and a site they have an account with suffers a leak,
      a criminal can easily gain unauthorized access to their other accounts.
      This is often done through large-scale automated login attempts, known as Credential Stuffing.
      Files with email addresses and their passwords having millions of records are available online.
      It’s easy to prevent—just use a unique password for each account.

  - point: Use a password manager
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      It is impossible for human to remember hundreds of strong and unique passwords. 
      A password manager is an application that generates, stores, and auto-fills your login credentials. 
      All your passwords are encrypted with one master passphrase, which you must remember and keep strong. 
      Most password managers have browser extensions and mobile apps, so your passwords can be auto-filled 
      on any device. 1Password is recommended by EF, and as a member you would get 
      [1Password Families](https://support.1password.com/explore/families/) subscription.

  - point: Avoid sharing passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      While there may be times when you need to share access to an account with another person, you should 
      generally avoid doing so, as it makes the account more vulnerable. If you must share a password—such 
      as when working on a team—it should be done using features built into a password manager. By creating 
      a vault in 1Password, you can share credentials only with those you choose, rather than exposing them 
      to the entire internet.

  - point: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      2FA is where you must provide both something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a 
      code from your device) to log in.
      This means that if anyone has your password, they still will not be able to access your account.
      It's easy to get started. Download [an authenticator app](https://ente.io/auth/) 
      onto your phone, then follow the steps for each account to enable 2FA and add it to the authenticator.
      Next time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code displayed in the app on your 
      phone (it works without internet, and the code usually changes every 30 seconds).

  - point: Avoid using SMS for 2FA
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When enabling multi-factor authentication, opt for app-based codes or a hardware token (Yubikey). SMS is
      susceptible to a number of common threats, such as [SIM-swapping](https://www.maketecheasier.com/sim-card-hijacking)
      and [interception](https://secure-voice.com/ss7_attacks). Your phone number is a public identifier and should
      not be used for authentication purposes. From a practical point of view, SMS only works when
      you have a signal and can be unreliable. If a bank website or payment service requires using an SMS number,
      consider purchasing a second prepaid secret phone number only used for account recovery in these instances.

  - point: Set up Hardware Token authentication
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      The most secure way to authenticate is a U2F/FIDO2 security key such as Yubikey. This is a device that you connect 
      while logging in to an online service to verify your identity. It brings several security benefits,
      since the browser communicates directly with the device and cannot be fooled as to which host is requesting
      authentication. Please follow the [EF Hardware Security Keys Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiQEDwV92hnrZhdgZk1paBp_HJtUlBOkUYYGZkJInFA/edit?tab=t.0)
      to proceed with getting and setting up your security keys. [Read more](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/71316/how-secure-are-the-fido-u2f-tokens/71704#71704) 
      opinion why this is so important.

  - point: Keep backup codes safe
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if
      your 2FA method is lost, broken, or unavailable. Keep these codes somewhere safe to prevent loss or
      unauthorized access. You should store them on always offline device, paper, or in an encrypted file.
      Don't store them in your primary password manager, as 2FA and passwords must be kept separate. By merging 
      them you defeat the entire purpose of second factor in the authentication process.

  - point: Sign up for Breach Alerts
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      After any website suffers a significant data breach, the leaked data often ends up on the internet. There
      are several websites that collect these leaked records and allow you to search your email address to check
      if you are in any of their lists. [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com) and [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)
      let you sign up for monitoring, where they will notify you if your email address appears in any new data sets.
      It is useful to know as soon as possible when this happens, so you can change your passwords for the affected accounts.

  - point: Shield your password / PIN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When typing your password in public places, ensure you are not in direct line of site of a CCTV camera and
      that no one is able to see over your shoulder. Cover your password or PIN code while you type, and do not
      reveal any plain text passwords on screen.

  - point: Don’t save your password in browsers
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Browsers offer to save your credentials when you log into a site. Don’t allow this, as they are not always encrypted, 
      hence could allow someone to gain access into your accounts. [Example toolkit](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData). 
      Instead use a dedicated password manager to store (and auto-fill) your passwords. Password manager extension in browser 
      will provide great user experience in a secure way.

  - point: Avoid logging in on someone else’s device
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Avoid logging in on other people's computers, as you can't be sure their system is clean. Be especially cautious 
      of public machines in hotels and airports, as malware and tracking are more common here. Using someone else's device 
      is particularly dangerous for critical accounts like email or online finance. When using someone else's machine, 
      ensure that you're in a private/incognito session (use File menu in browser to open it). This will request the browser 
      not to save your credentials, cookies, and browsing history.

  - point: Avoid password hints
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Some sites allow you to set password hints. Often, it is very easy to guess the answers. In cases where password hints
      are mandatory, use random answers and record them in a password manager (e.g., `Name of the first school: SmelledNotLikeHogwarts`).

  - point: Never answer online security questions truthfully
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If a site asks security questions (such as place of birth, mother's maiden name, or first car, etc.), don't provide
      real answers. It is a trivial task for hackers to find out this information online or through social engineering.
      Instead, create a fictitious answer and store it inside your password manager. 
      Make sure that your fake answers aren't autogenerated nonsense like "N_9bKTC_i94". Many password reset flows 
      involve communicating a security answer over the phone, and it's easy enough for an attacker to guess 
      "oh, it's just a bunch of random characters" and for the customer support to just shrug and let the person in. 

  - point: Don’t use a 4-digit PIN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Don't use a short PIN to access your smartphone or computer. Instead, use a text password or PIN code of undefined length.
      Numeric passphrases are easy to crack - a 4-digit PIN has only 10,000 combinations, compared to billions of possibilities
      when an attacker doesn't know the length and has to check every possible case.

  - point: Avoid using your Password Manager to generate 2FA codes
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Most password managers are also able to generate 2FA OTP codes. It is best not to use your primary password manager
      as your 2FA authenticator as well, since it would become a single point of failure if compromised. Instead use a
      dedicated authenticator app on your phone or laptop, with separate encryption and authentication.

  - point: Understand Face Unlock feature
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Most phones and laptops offer a facial recognition authentication feature, using the camera to compare a snapshot
      of your face with a stored model. It may be very convenient, but there are numerous ways to fool it
      and gain access to the device, if it's implemented incorrectly. An example of good implementation is Apple TrueDepth 
      camera system which uses infrared dot projector to build a 3D map of your face. It requires a realistic 3D facial model 
      or an identical twin to attempt to bypass (which is relatively rare). But general Android phone can be fooled by photo 
      of your face from the Internet, or from videos recorded by surveillance cameras.

  - point: Watch out for keyloggers
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      A hardware [keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_keylogger) is a physical device planted between
      your keyboard and the USB port, which intercepts all key strokes, and sometimes can type in malicious commands.
      It gives a hacker access to everything typed, including passwords. It is also possible for keyloggers to be planted
      inside the cable, so look for any signs that the cables or connectors have been tampered with. Data pasted from the 
      clipboard or auto-filled by a password manager can not be intercepted by a hardware keylogger.

  - point: Deploy offline password manager
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      For increased security, an offline password manager will give you full control over your most sensitive data,
      such as backup codes, seed phrases, PGP revocation certificates, and backups of your primary password manager.
      [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) is a popular choice, and it has many community forks with additional compatibility and 
      functionality for every operating system. Running it on a device that never connects to the network is required
      to achieve ultimate security.

  - point: Use unique usernames
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Having different passwords for each account is a first step, but if you also use a unique username, email or
      phone number during registration, then it will be significantly harder for anyone trying to gain access. The easiest
      method for multiple emails, is using mail forwarding. This is where [random]@service.com will arrive in your inbox, 
      allowing you to make your real email address private. [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/) and [DuckDuckGo Email Protection](https://duckduckgo.com/email/)
      are examples of email forwarders. Usernames are easier, since you can use your password manager 
      to generate, store and auto-fill these. 

- title: Web Browsing
  slug: web-browsing
  description: Avoiding tracking, censorship, and data collection online
  icon: browser
  color: emerald
  intro: >-
    Most websites on the internet will use some form of tracking, often to gain
    insight into their users' behavior and preferences. This data can be incredibly
    detailed and is extremely valuable to corporations, governments, and intellectual
    property thieves. Data breaches and leaks are common, and deanonymizing users' web
    activity is often a trivial task.
    
    This section outlines the steps you can take to be better protected from threats,
    minimize online tracking, and improve privacy.
  checklist:
  - point: Block ads
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Using an ad-blocker can help improve your privacy by blocking the trackers that ads implement.
      [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is recommended open-source browser addon. 
      When third-party ads are displayed on a webpage, they have the ability to
      track you, gathering personal information about you and your habits, which then would be sold or used
      to show you more targeted ads. Some ads are also malicious or fake. Blocking ads makes pages
      load faster, uses less data, and provides a better experience.

  - point: Ensure you visit a legitimate website
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      It may sound obvious, but when you sign into any online accounts or download software: double check if
      it's really an original website. If you use a search engine, often the top results are paid ads.
      Storing commonly visited sites in your bookmarks is a good way to ensure the URL is easy to find. When
      visiting new websites, look for common signs that it could be unsafe: browser warnings, multiple redirects,
      on-site spam and pop-ups. You can also check a website using a tool such as
      [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/) or [IsLegitSite](https://www.islegitsite.com) if you are unsure.

  - point: Use a privacy-respecting browser
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Your browser has access to everything that you do online, so avoid Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari as 
      (with default configuration) all three of them collect usage data, call home, and allow for invasive tracking. 
      [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Brave](https://brave.com/)
      are more secure, privacy-respecting browsers. Both are fast, open source, user-friendly, and available on all
      major operating systems. But even Firefox requires [quite a few changes](https://codeberg.org/12bytes/firefox-config-guide) 
      to achieve optimal security.

  - point: Use a private search engine
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      It is recommended to update your browser's default search to a privacy-respecting search engine.
      Using such a non-tracking search engine will reduce the risk that your search terms are used against you. 
      Consider [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/), or [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/).
      Google implements some [incredibly invasive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTsBP21-XpI)
      tracking policies and has a history of displaying biased search results.
      Therefore, Google, along with Bing, Baidu, Yahoo, and many others, are incompatible with anyone looking to protect
      their privacy.

  - point: Remove unnecessary browser addons
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Extensions (addons) can see, log, or modify anything you do in the browser, and some innocent-looking
      browser apps have malicious intentions. Websites can see which extensions you have installed and may
      use this to enhance your fingerprint, to more accurately identify/track you. Both Firefox and Chrome
      web stores allow you to check what permissions/access rights an extension requires before you install it.
      Check the reviews, GitHub repository, who's the author of the extension. Only install extensions you 
      really need, and remove those which you installed just in case.

  - point: Disable password storage in browser
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Do not allow your browser to store usernames and passwords. These can be easily accessed or exported.
      [Example tool](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData). Instead use a [password manager](/checklist/authentication/#done-use-a-password-manager).

  - point: Check for HTTPS
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If you enter information on a non-HTTPS website, this data is transported unencrypted and can therefore
      be read and modified by anyone along the route. Do not enter any data on a non-HTTPS website, but also do not let
      the green padlock give you a false sense of security. Just because a website has an SSL certificate does
      not mean that it is legitimate or trustworthy. Pay attention to the domain name: sometimes the difference between
      website.org and website.com can cost a fortune.

  - point: Use DNS-over-HTTPS
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Traditional DNS makes requests in plain text, allowing for eavesdropping and web-filtering by your provider,
      which by default provides you with their DNS service. DNS-over-HTTPS performs DNS
      resolution via the HTTPS protocol, meaning data between you and your DNS resolver is encrypted.
      A popular option is CloudFlare's [1.1.1.1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/),
      which has instructions for all supported browsers.

  - point: Use Incognito mode with caution
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you're in a private/incognito window, it will prevent browser history, cookies, and some data from being 
      saved, but you are still easily tracked unless you close all other browser windows and then connect to a VPN. 
      Even then, it is not fool-proof, so keep in mind these functions are not really making your actions anonymous.

  - point: Understand your browser's fingerprint
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Browser fingerprinting is an incredibly accurate method of tracking, allowing a website to identify you
      based on your device information—even after you clear all cookies and session data. You can view your fingerprint
      at [amiunique.org](https://amiunique.org) to see what parameters are evaluated. There is no perfect solution against
      fingerprinting, but using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) and disabling JavaScript in your settings 
      will reduce the data your browser leaks; although this will break many websites.

  - point: Block third-party trackers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Blocking trackers will help prevent websites, advertisers, analytics, and more from tracking you on
      all websites you visit. [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/),
      [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension),
      and [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) 
      are all very effective, open-source tracker blockers available for all major browsers.

  - point: Beware of redirects
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      While some redirects are harmless, others, such as unvalidated redirects, are used in phishing attacks,
      making a malicious link seem legitimate. If you are unsure about a redirect URL, you can check
      where it forwards to with a tool like [RedirectDetective](https://redirectdetective.com/). This applies
      to cases where you see a long URL with parameters you don't understand, which can look like 
      `https://legitimate-site.com/something/is?suspicious=b2ggeWVzIGl0J3MgZGVmaW5pdGVseSBzdXNwaWNpb3VzJw==`.

  - point: Block web notifications
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Browser push notifications are a common method for criminals to spam you and make you click their links, 
      as it is easy to spoof the source. Be aware of this; if a website asks you for permission to "Show notifications", 
      you should block it in 99% of cases. [How the prompt looks like?](https://d24oheizjk2k1o.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/25220742/smaller_hero-image-dangers-of-installing-web-push-incorrectly.png). 
      For instructions on disabling browser notifications, see [this article](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-disable-web-notifications).
  
  - point: Use Multi-Account Containers
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Using different profiles for work, general browsing, social media, and banking will reduce the number of associations 
      that data brokers can link back to you. [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) 
      is a unique feature designed exactly for this purpose. Alternatively, you could use different browsers 
      for different tasks, which is not as convenient but has the same security improvement.

  - point: Disable automatic downloads
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Drive-by downloads is a common method of getting harmful files onto a users device. This can be mitigated
      by disabling auto file downloads, and being cautious of websites which prompt you to download files unexpectedly.
      Any downloaded file can be checked for obvious infection at [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/),
      which will find known virus signatures. Or it could be opened on a separate virtual machine outside of
      your computer at [Any.run](https://app.any.run/), allowing you to safely examine any malware.

  - point: Disallow access to sensors
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Mobile websites can tap into some of your device sensors without asking. If you grant these permissions to your
      browser once, then all websites are able to use these capabilities, without permission or notification. 
      Such sensors allow to detect device movement and orientation, track position and ambient lightning changes.

  - point: Disallow location access
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Location Services let sites ask for your physical location. This should be disabled in settings as it 
      will give the exact location to meters. On every legitimate website, there would be a way to input the address
      instead of using the physical location. Note that there are still other methods of determining your approximate location.

  - point: Disallow camera/microphone access
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Check browser settings to ensure that no websites are granted access to webcam or microphone. It may also
      be beneficial to use physical protection such as a webcam cover and microphone blocker.

  - point: Strip tracking params from URLs
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Websites often append additional parameters to URLs that you share, to link you with the recipient.
      Example: `https://youtu.be/VTsBP21-XpI?si=1aBj9DFSaHk_XorM` has `?si=1aBj9DFSaHk_XorM`, 
      `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFAdz9HNRzu/?igsh=MXUxbnJ1czZlMWg0Ng==` has `?igsh=MXUxbnJ1czZlMWg0Ng==`
      which you should remove before sharing. You can sanitize manually, or use an extension like 
      [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) to strip tracking data from URLs automatically.

  - point: Install the Tor Browser
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      The [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) provides a browser that encrypts and routes your traffic 
      through multiple nodes, keeping users safe from regular technics of interception and tracking. The main 
      drawbacks are speed and user experience. Tor Browser could connect to anonymously hosted websites
      which end in `.onion`. For additional security consider using [Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System)](https://tails.net/)
      which boots from USB and does not write to the hard drive, ensuring no residual data is left behind 
      after reboot. It includes Tor Browser pre-installed for anonymous web browsing, and other encryption tools.

- title: Email
  slug: email
  color: teal
  description: Protecting the gateway to your online accounts
  icon: email
  intro: >-
    If a hacker gains access to your inbox, it provides a gateway for your other accounts to be compromised 
    through password resets, and for your information to leak (think about how much bank, travel, and medical 
    data has been sent to you over the years). Therefore, email security is paramount for your digital safety.

  checklist:
  - point: Use a secure mail provider
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      The companies providing "free" email service don't have a good reputation for respecting users' privacy: 
      Gmail was caught [tracking all of your purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/google-gmail-tracks-purchase-history-how-to-delete-it.html).
      Any US provider will provide your data on request by US government agencies.
      Advertisers [were granted access](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2018/08/29/both-yahoo-and-aol-are-scanning-customer-emails-to-attract-advertisers)
      to Yahoo and AOL users messages to “identify and segment potential customers by picking up on contextual 
      buying signals, and past purchases.”

      Start by registering a new mailbox and switching the most important communications to it one by one.
      Secure and reputable email providers such as: [Tuta Mail](https://tuta.com/secure-email), [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail),
      [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en), [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/), or [Disroot](https://disroot.org)
      allow mailbox encryption, are privacy-focused, as well as offer more security-focused features.

  - point: Secure your email account
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA, enable hardware key authentication, disable recovery using phone number  
      and follow every advice from the [Authentication Checklist](/checklist/authentication). Your email account 
      provides an easy entry point to all your other online accounts for an attacker.

  - point: Have more than one email address
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Consider using a different email address for security-critical communications from trivial mail such
      as newsletters or shopping. This compartmentalization would reduce the amount of damage caused by a data breach,
      and also make it easier to recover a compromised account. Email aliases and email forwarding are your
      friends on this path.

  - point: Share only public email address
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often the starting point for most
      phishing attacks. Use separate aliases for different activities and set up mail filters to apply distinct
      labels to incoming emails based on the recipient.

  - point: Don't share sensitive data via email
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Emails can be intercepted and recorded during transit. Additionally, you cannot be certain of the security 
      of your recipient's mail provider. Therefore, email should not be considered safe for exchanging 
      confidential information unless it is PGP-encrypted. If your recipient does not support encryption, 
      instead of attaching a sensitive file consider emailing a private link to the file, where you can later
      revoke the access by that link.

  - point: Don’t connect third-party apps to your email account
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you give a third-party app access to your inbox, they effectively have full unhindered
      access to all your emails and their contents, which poses significant security and privacy risks.

  - point: Use a custom domain
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Registering a custom domain allows you to switch email providers easily without losing your email address. 
      This flexibility ensures you are not tied to a single provider and can avoid disruptions if a service is 
      discontinued. You can get your own domain from providers like [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) for 
      under $15/year, which can be used for both website and email purposes.

  - point: Use aliasing / domain forwarding
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to `[anything]@my-own-domain.com` and still land in your primary inbox.
      Effectively allowing you to use a different, unique email address for each service you sign up for. This means
      if you start receiving spam, you can block that alias and determine which company leaked your email address.

  - point: Subaddressing
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you don't own a custom domain, an alternative to aliasing is subaddressing, where anything after the `+` 
      symbol is omitted during mail delivery, e.g. `johnsmith+[anything]@gmail.com` will be delivered to `johnsmith`
      inbox. This sometimes enables you to keep track of who shared/leaked your email address, but unlike aliasing, 
      it will not protect against your real address being revealed.

  - point: Have a backup copy of your mailbox
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      To avoid losing access to your emails during an outage or account lock, [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)
      can sync/backup messages from multiple accounts via IMAP and store locally on your computer. 
      For Gmail you could use [got-your-back](https://github.com/GAM-team/got-your-back/wiki) tool.

  - point: Be careful with email signatures
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Do not write your phone number or social network handles when you set email signatures. There are several
      marketing extensions that automatically crawl messages, and gather a detailed database of contact information 
      based upon email signatures for sale. One of your recipients will have it.

  - point: Be careful with auto-replies
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Out-of-office automatic replies are very useful for informing others there will be a delay in replying, but 
      sometimes people reveal too much information - which can be used in social engineering and targeted attacks
      right when they are away and cannot keep an eye on the account. Your email provider should offer you a choice
      who would get the auto-reply.

  intro: >-
    Every message and photo you send has a chance to become publicly available. Don't write anything you'd regret
    and learn how to decrease that chance.

  checklist:
  - point: Use End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) messengers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      End-to-end encryption ensures that messages are encrypted on your device and remain encrypted until 
      they reach the intended recipient. This guarantees that any intercepted traffic cannot be read by 
      unauthorized parties, including those with access to the servers where the conversation data is stored.

  - point: Use Open Source messengers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If the code is open source then it can be independently examined and audited by anyone qualified to do
      so, to ensure that there are no backdoors, vulnerabilities, or other security issues. Most popular 
      projects will publish results of such reviews.

  - point: Use "trustworthy" messengers
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When selecting an encrypted messaging app, ensure its server is open source, stable, actively maintained,
      and ideally backed by reputable developers. Some good options in 2025 are [Matrix](https://matrix.org/),
      which has many clients available, all based on a secure open source protocol, [Signal](https://signal.org/),
      and [Jami](https://jami.net/). [Tox](https://tox.chat/) and [Session](https://getsession.org/) don't even 
      have a centralized server.

  - point: Check security settings
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Go through the security and privacy settings in your messenger, including contact verification, security 
      notifications, and encryption. Disable optional privacy-leaking features such as read receipts, last online, 
      and typing notifications.

  - point: Secure group chats
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Don't use Telegram: every group chat in it is plain text unencrypted, just waiting to leak. For encrypted 
      groups in Matrix/Signal/Tox, the risk of compromise rises the more participants are in a group. Periodically 
      check that all members should still be there.

  - point: Understand media metadata
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Metadata is additional information attached to media. When you send a photo, audio recording, video, or 
      document you may be revealing more than you intended to: date, location, information identifying you
      or device may be included with it.

  - point: Verify your correspondent
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Prior to any financial transaction initiated in messenger it's always good to ensure you are talking to the 
      intended recipient, and that they have not been compromised. Make a call, find another contact through friends
      or colleagues.

  - point: Enable self-destructing messages
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Self-destructing messages is a feature that causes your messages to automatically delete after a set amount
      of time. Together with encryption this means that if your device is lost, stolen, or seized, an adversary 
      will only have access to the most recent communications.

  - point: Avoid SMS
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      SMS is not secure. It is susceptible to threats such as interception, SIM swapping, SIM porting, and smartphone 
      malware. It's ok to SMS "Message me on Matrix: https://matrix.to/".

  description: Minimizing the risks associated with using online communities
  icon: social
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and give
    people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and share.
    Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction and
    bring people together, that have a dark side - there are some serious
    [Privacy Concerns with Social Networking Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services),
    and these social networking sites are owned by private corporations,
    and that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and
    selling that data on, often to third party advertisers.

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even
    after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is
    effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
  - point: Secure your Account
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To protect your account: use a unique
      and strong password, and enable 2-factor authentication.

  - point: Check Privacy Settings
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure that you are comfortable with
      what data you are currently exposing and to whom.

  - point: Think of All Interactions as Public
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      There are still numerous methods of viewing a users 'private' content across many social networks.
      Therefore, before uploading, posting or commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public?"

  - point: Think of All Interactions as Permanent
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Pretty much every post, comment, photo etc is being continuously backed up by a myriad of third-party
      services, who archive this data and make it indexable and publicly available almost forever.

  - point: Don't Reveal too Much
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of data that helps them personalize
      phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc).

  - point: Be Careful what you Upload
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Status updates, comments, check-ins and media can unintentionally reveal a lot more than you intended
      them to. This is especially relevant to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.

  - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls and spammers more munition to
      use against you, and can also allow separate aliases, profiles or data points to be connected.

  - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      By default many of the popular social networking apps will ask for permission to access your contacts,
      call log, location, messaging history etc. If they don’t need this access, don’t grant it.

  - point: Be Careful of 3rd-Party Integrations
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Avoid signing up for accounts using a Social Network login, revoke access to social apps you no longer
      use.

  - point: Avoid Publishing Geo Data while still Onsite
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If you plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait until you have left that place.
      This is particularly important when you are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
      building or airport.

  - point: Remove metadata before uploading media
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Most smartphones and some cameras automatically attach a comprehensive set of additional data (called
      EXIF data) to each photograph. Remove this data before uploading.

  - point: Implement Image Cloaking
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Tools like Fawkes can be used to very subtly, slightly change the structure of faces within photos in a
      way that is imperceptible by humans, but will prevent facial recognition systems from being able to recognize
      a given face.

  - point: Consider Spoofing GPS in home vicinity
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Even if you yourself never use social media, there is always going to be others who are not as careful,
      and could reveal your location.

  - point: Consider False Information
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      If you just want to read, and do not intend on posting too much- consider using an alias name, and false
      contact details.

  - point: Don’t have any social media accounts
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Social media is fundamentally un-private, so for maximum online security and privacy, avoid using any
      mainstream social networks.

  description: Safeguarding your network traffic
  icon: network
  intro: >
    This section covers how you connect your devices to the internet securely,
    including configuring your router and setting up a VPN.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a VPN
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Use a reputable, paid-for VPN. This can help protect sites you visit from logging your real IP, reduce
      the amount of data your ISP can collect, and increase protection on public WiFi.

  - point: Change your Router Password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      After getting a new router, change the password. Default router passwords are publicly available,
      meaning anyone within proximity would be able to connect.

  - point: Use WPA2, and a strong password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      There are different authentication protocols for connecting to WiFi. Currently, the most secure options
      are WPA2 and WPA3 (on newer routers).

  - point: Keep router firmware up-to-date
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Manufacturers release firmware updates that fix security vulnerabilities, implement new standards, and
      sometimes add features or improve the performance of your router.

  - point: Implement a Network-Wide VPN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you configure your VPN on your router, firewall, or home server, then traffic from all devices will
      be encrypted and routed through it, without needing individual VPN apps.

  - point: Protect against DNS leaks
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When using a VPN, it is extremely important to exclusively use the DNS server of your VPN provider or
      secure service.

  - point: Use a secure VPN Protocol
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      OpenVPN and WireGuard are open source, lightweight, and secure tunneling protocols. Avoid using PPTP
      or SSTP.

  - point: Secure DNS
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Use DNS-over-HTTPS which performs DNS resolution via the HTTPS protocol, encrypting data between you
      and your DNS resolver.

  - point: Avoid the free router from your ISP
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Typically they’re manufactured cheaply in bulk in China, with insecure propriety firmware that doesn't
      receive regular security updates.

  - point: Whitelist MAC Addresses
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      You can whitelist MAC addresses in your router settings, disallowing any unknown devices to immediately
      connect to your network, even if they know your credentials.

  - point: Change the Router’s Local IP Address
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      It is possible for a malicious script in your web browser to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability,
      accessing known-vulnerable routers at their local IP address and tampering with them.

  - point: Don't Reveal Personal Info in SSID
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      You should update your network name, choosing an SSID that does not identify you, include your flat
      number/address, and does not specify the device brand/model.

  - point: Opt-Out Router Listings
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      WiFi SSIDs are scanned, logged, and then published on various websites, which is a serious privacy
      concern for some.

  - point: Hide your SSID
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Your router's Service Set Identifier is simply the network name. If it is not visible, it may receive
      less abuse.

  - point: Disable WPS
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Wi-Fi Protected Setup provides an easier method to connect, without entering a long WiFi password, but
      WPS introduces a series of major security issues.

  - point: Disable UPnP
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Universal Plug and Play allows applications to automatically forward a port on your router, but it has
      a long history of serious security issues.

  - point: Use a Guest Network for Guests
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Do not grant access to your primary WiFi network to visitors, as it enables them to interact with other
      devices on the network.

  - point: Change your Router's Default IP
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Modifying your router admin panel's default IP address will make it more difficult for malicious scripts
      targeting local IP addresses.

  - point: Kill unused processes and services on your router
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Services like Telnet and SSH that provide command-line access to devices should never be exposed to the
      internet and should also be disabled on the local network unless they're actually needed.

  - point: Don't have Open Ports
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Close any open ports on your router that are not needed. Open ports provide an easy entrance for hackers.

  - point: Disable Unused Remote Access Protocols
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When protocols such as PING, Telnet, SSH, UPnP, and HNAP etc are enabled, they allow your router to be
      probed from anywhere in the world.

  - point: Disable Cloud-Based Management
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      You should treat your router's admin panel with the utmost care, as considerable damage can be caused
      if an attacker is able to gain access.

  - point: Manage Range Correctly
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      It's common to want to pump your router's range to the max, but if you reside in a smaller flat, your
      attack surface is increased when your WiFi network can be picked up across the street.

  - point: Route all traffic through [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor)
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      VPNs have their weaknesses. For increased security, route all your internet traffic through the [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor)
      network.

  - point: Disable WiFi on all Devices
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Connecting to even a secure WiFi network increases your attack surface. Disabling your home WiFi and
      connect each device via Ethernet.

  description: Reduce invasive tracking for cells, smartphones and tablets
  icon: mobile
  intro: >
    Smart phones have revolutionized so many aspects of life and brought the world
    to our fingertips. For many of us, smart phones are our primary means of communication,
    entertainment and access to knowledge. But while they've brought convenience
    to whole new level, there's some ugly things going on behind the screen.

    Geo-tracking is used to trace our every move, and we have little control over
    who has this data- your phone is even able to
    [track your location without GPS](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371).
    Over the years numerous reports that surfaced, outlining ways in which your
    phone's [mic can eavesdrop](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html),
    and the [camera can watch you](https://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-governments-smartphone-iphone-camera-wikileaks-cybersecurity-hack-privacy-webcam-2017-6)- all without your knowledge or consent.
    And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches and potential/ likely backdoors.

    Using a smart phone generates a lot of data about you- from information you
    intentionally share, to data silently generated from your actions.
    It can be scary to see what Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook know about
    us- sometimes they know more than our closest family. It's hard to comprehend
    what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data.

    This data is used for
    [far more than just advertising](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-data-tracking/) -
    more often it's used to rate people for finance, insurance and employment.
    Targeted ads can even be used for fine-grained surveillance (see [ADINT](https://adint.cs.washington.edu))

    More of us are concerned about how
    [governments use collect and use our smart phone data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373916/global-opinion-online-monitoring-government/),
    and rightly so, federal agencies often
    [request our data from Google](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273501/global-data-requests-from-google-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/287845/global-data-requests-from-facebook-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. Sometimes requests are
    made in bulk, returning detailed information on everybody within a certain geo-fence,
    [often for innocent people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html).
    And this doesn't include all of the internet traffic that intelligence agencies around the world have unhindered access to.
  checklist:
  - point: Encrypt your Device
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      In order to keep your data safe from physical access, use file encryption. This will mean if your
      device is lost or stolen, no one will have access to your data.

  - point: Turn off connectivity features that aren’t being used
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you're not using WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC etc, turn those features off. There are several common threats
      that utilise these features.

  - point: Keep app count to a minimum
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Uninstall apps that you don’t need or use regularly. As apps often run in the background, slowing your
      device down, but also collecting data.

  - point: App Permissions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Don’t grant apps permissions that they don’t need. For Android, [Bouncer](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/mobile-apps/bouncer) is an app that allows you to grant
      temporary/ 1-off permissions.

  - point: Only install Apps from official source

      ensure it is reputable.

  - point: Restart Device Regularly
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Restarting your phone at least once a week will clear the app state cached in memory and may run more smoothly
      after a restart.

  - point: Avoid SMS
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      SMS should not be used to receive 2FA codes or for communication, instead use an encrypted messaging app,
      such as [Signal](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/encrypted-messaging/signal).

  - point: Keep your Number Private
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      [MySudo](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/finance/virtual-credit-cards/mysudo) allows
      you to create and use virtual phone numbers for different people or groups. This is great for
      compartmentalisation.

  - point: Watch out for Stalkerware
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Stalkerware is malware that is installed directly onto your device by someone you know.
      The best way to get rid of it is through a factory reset.

  - point: Favor the Browser, over Dedicated App
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Where possible, consider using a secure browser to access sites,
      rather than installing dedicated applications.

  - point: Consider running a custom ROM (Android)
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-

  description: Using IoT devices without compromising your privacy
  icon: home
  intro: >-
    Home assistants (such as Google Home, Alexa and Siri) and other internet connected
    devices collect large amounts of personal data (including voice samples, location data,
    home details and logs of all interactions). Since you have limited control on what is
    being collected, how it's stored, and what it will be used for, this makes it hard to
    recommend any consumer smart-home products to anyone who cares about privacy and security.

    Security vs Privacy: There are many smart devices on the market that claim to increase
    the security of your home while being easy and convenient to use (Such as Smart Burglar
    Alarms, Internet Security Cameras, Smart Locks and Remote access Doorbells to name a few).
    These devices may appear to make security easier, but there is a trade-off in terms of
    privacy: as they collect large amounts of personal data, and leave you without control
    over how this is stored or used. The security of these devices is also questionable,
    since many of them can be (and are being) hacked, allowing an intruder to bypass
    detection with minimum effort.

    The most privacy-respecting option, would be to not use "smart" internet-connected
    devices in your home, and not to rely on a security device that requires an internet
    connection. But if you do, it is important to fully understand the risks of any given
    product, before buying it. Then adjust settings to increase privacy and security.
    The following checklist will help mitigate the risks associated with
    internet-connected home devices.

    Credit card fraud is the most common form of identity theft (with [133,015 reports in the
    US in 2017 alone](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/identity-theft-statistics/)),
    and a total loss of $905 million, which was a 26% increase from the previous year.
